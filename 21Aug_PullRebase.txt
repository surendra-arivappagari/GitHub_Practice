This is for Pull option with Rebase.
  Example Scenario:
     1.You have done cahnges in Remote Github.
     2.YOu have done few more changes into local.
     3.When we try pull option, it will through error. Because Remote and local are not in sync.
          :Solution:
              3A. With Rebase pull in local, it will point to old local changes, 
              3B. then pull changes apply into local   ,
              3C. Now what ever we done changes in Local, it will apply after the 3B step. 
              
              So that, every step will be in sync, we can gettid of confusion to GIt.
